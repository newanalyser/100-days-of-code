# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Signed up for DataCamp Python Course. Starting from the basics

### Day 2: April 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Dug out my old Udemy and Stackskills courses on Python. I know I had started this before but never got around to pulling through with learning everything. Started with Udemy. Went through Expressions, Functions, Reading and Writing Files.

**Thoughts**: I paid for these courses and never used them. Good thing that they're still available. After the #100daysofcode, the goal is not only to know Python, but to apply it to ethical hacking and then learn those skills.  

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
